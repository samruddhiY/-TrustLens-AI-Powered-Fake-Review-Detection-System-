Developed an intelligent web-based system to detect fake or deceptive reviews using machine learning and NLP techniques. 
The solution includes advanced text processing (TF-IDF vectorization), handcrafted features (exclamation count, uppercase ratio, and review length), and a logistic regression model for binary classification (genuine vs fake).
Designed a clean and interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing users to input or paste review text and instantly get prediction results with an intuitive interface.
